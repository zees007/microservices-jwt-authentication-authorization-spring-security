Are you new to microservices? Struggling to understand how to create services, how they communicate with each other, how to secure them using JWT, integrate an API gateway, log and monitor your services, containerize them, or deploy them to a Kubernetes cluster? Don‚Äôt worry, this microservices series is just for you.

<h1>Welcome to DevZees ‚ù§ </h1>

This series is designed to be comprehensive and provide a detailed, step-by-step implementation of each topic. To facilitate learning, I have broken it down into multiple parts as below. I encourage you to follow each tutorial with me for a practical hands-on experience with microservices.
